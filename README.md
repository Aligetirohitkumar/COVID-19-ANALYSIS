# COVID-19-ANALYSIS

Project Title: Advanced Data Analysis with Python and Jupyter Notebook

Description:
This project utilizes Python with Jupyter Notebook to perform advanced data analysis. The analysis combines three datasets:

1.[covid19_Confirmed_dataset.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17930742/covid19_Confirmed_dataset.csv)

2.[covid19_deaths_dataset.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17930746/covid19_deaths_dataset.csv)

3.[worldwide_happiness_report.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17930747/worldwide_happiness_report.csv)

The project explores the relationship between COVID-19 impacts and global happiness. 
Several visualizations (PNG images) were generated as outputs to provide insights into the data.
